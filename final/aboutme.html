    </h1>
    <p>
Hi! My name is Sarah, and I am the Creative Specialist behind Simply Tickled Shop!
    </p>

    <p>
While my husband was away, serving overseas, I needed a hobby to pass the time, so I began knitting! Eventually, people started asking me if I would sell my scarves, so I began building an inventory and vision for the shop. I use quality materials that ensure durability, while also selecting yarns that are soft and comfortable so they are practical and easy to wear everyday!
    </p>

    <p>
I'm all about cozy and stylish items, so I soon expanded my collection of scarves to include decorative throws. These over-sized, chunky knit throws are the perfect addition to any bed, sofa, bench, or chair. 
    </p>

    <p>
When I'm not knitting, you will find me trying a new recipe in the kitchen, hiking new-found trails, taking a jog, or trying a new coffee shop!
    </p>
